This is a preliminary work from my research on Reinforcement Learning-based Construction Schedule Optimization. A sample project data is added within the code for evaluation. 
If you need to try it on a different project, feel free to change the project specific details, like number of elements, resource requirements, resource availability, and weather conditions, among others.
